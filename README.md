# AdventOfCode2023

Problems are solved in golang, for fun and learning.

Background: I am a software developer & computer cience student with a bit of C/C++ and mainly Java/C# background. I wanted to explore Go as it is becoming popular every single day.

Impressions & Notes:

- Go is ugly! For someone who is familiar with long but self explaning statements in C# or Java, Go is pretty much ugly.
- Although it is a new language. community support is good. Stack Overflow can help a lot.
- Lots of packages under std, and they are verymuch capable of doing everything. But importing each one one by one is again; ugly.
